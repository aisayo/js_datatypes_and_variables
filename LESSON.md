# Data Types and Variables in JS

## Objectives

## Segment 1:

### The Set up - (5 minutes)

Take a second to go over our file structure.
Lightly touch on how our JavaScript file is being rendered by our script tag in our index.html. We are going to be playing around in the console so we shouldn’t need a deep dive into the DOM yet.

### The Console - (5 minutes)

Open up your dev tools and give a quick tour, touching on the element and network tabs but mostly focus on the console.

Encourage students to play around in the console by test out some code. Its a good time to do a quick review of some primitive types and operations.

### Debugging - (10 minutes)

Debugging is most of development, our lectures should have a number of built in bugs to help students familiarize themselves with their tools. It's also important to encourage a culture of error. Anytime you as a lecture run into a bug, use it as a teaching opportunity. Encourage being wrong and not knowing the answer, but knowing how to problem solve and get to a solution.

`Errors`, `Console.log` and `debugger` are our new best friends.

Add some code that will error out to your index.js and walk students through the error.
What is this error trying to tell us? What line is our error at? What is “Uncaught ReferenceError” What does “cat is not defined” mean?
