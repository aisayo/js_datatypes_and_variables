# Data Types and Variables in JS

## Objectives

## Segment 1:

### Introduction - (5 minutes)

Introduce students to the lecture style. Here we can discuss classroom etiquette. Make students feel comfortable and build a positive culture for learning. Encourage students to be present and participant in their learning experience. Provide students with a repository and go over git flow to provide context on how to utilize repositories. Go over best practices for following along lectures. Allow students the option to code along however discuss the pros and cons of missing information if student becomes stuck on an error if they are coding along.

### The Set up - (5 minutes)

Take a second to go over our file structure.
Lightly touch on how our JavaScript file is being rendered by our script tag in our index.html. We are going to be playing around in the console so we shouldnâ€™t need a deep dive into the DOM yet.

### The Console - (5 minutes)

Open up your dev tools and give a quick tour, touching on the element and network tabs but mostly focus on the console.

Encourage students to play around in the console by test out some code. Its a good time to do a quick review of some primitive types and operations.

### Debugging - (10 minutes)

Debugging is most of development, our lectures should have a number of built in bugs to help students familiarize themselves with their tools. It's also important to encourage a culture of error. Anytime you as a lecture run into a bug, use it as a teaching opportunity. Encourage being wrong and not knowing the answer, but knowing how to problem solve and get to a solution.

`Errors`, `Console.log` and `debugger` are our new best friends.

Console:
Go over console in dev tools and discuss gotcha's in console's i.e variable redeclarations allowed. Best practice to code in JS file and run files in console
